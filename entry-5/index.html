              <p class="letter"><span class="first-letter">In Mongolian,</span> the instrument is usually called morin
                  khuur [mɔrin xʊːr] or "horse
                  fiddle".</p>
              <p class="letter">The full Classical Mongolian name for the morin khuur is morin toloğay’ta quğur,
                  (which in modern Khalkh cyrillic is Морин толгойтой хуур) meaning fiddle with a horse's head.
                  Usually it is abbreviated as "Морин хуур", Latin transcription "Morin huur". In western Mongolia it
                  is known as ikil (Mongolian: икил—not to be confused with the similar Tuvan igil)—while in eastern
                  Mongolia it is known as shoor (Mongolian: Шоор).

          <div class="text">
              <p class="letter"><span class="first-letter">One legend</span> about the origin of the morin khuur is
                  that a shepherd named Namjil the
                  Cuckoo (or Khuhuu Namjil) received the gift of a flying horse; he would mount it at night and fly to
                  meet his beloved. A jealous woman had the horse's wings cut off so that the horse fell from the air
                  and died. The grieving shepherd made a horsehead fiddle from the now-wingless horse's skin and tail
                  hair and used it to play poignant songs about his horse.</p>
              <p class="letter">Another legend credits the invention of the morin khuur to a boy named Sükhe (or
                  Suho). After a
                  wicked lord slew the boy's prized white horse, the horse's spirit came to Sükhe in a dream and
                  instructed him to make an instrument from the horse's body, so the two could still be together and
                  neither would be lonely. So the first morin khuur was assembled, with horse bones as its neck,
                  horsehair strings, horse skin covering its wooden soundbox, and its scroll carved into the shape of
                  a horse head.
              </p>
              <p class="letter">
                  The fact that most of the eastern Turkic neighbors of the Mongols possess similar horse hair
                  instruments (such as the Tuvan igil, the Kazakh kobyz, or the Kyrgyz Kyl kyyak), though not western
                  Turkic, may point to a possible origin amongst peoples that once inhabited the Mongolian
                  Steppe,[citation needed] and migrated to what is now Tuva, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.
